# 1) Try to make some plots of the distribution of the number of photons using TTree::Draw.
# You could write an expression like â€œint(mu_truth_leading_photon_pt > 0) + int(mu_truth_subleading_photon_pt > 0)"
# 2) Make plots of the bare muon pT for events with 0,1,2 photons
# 3) Try to get the W mass fitting code to work with these variables. Use mu_truth_bare_pt and V_TRUE_M (for the weight).
# mu_truth_leading_photon_pt = 0 // the pT of the highest pT photon near the muon (if there is one)
# mu_truth_subleading_photon_pt = 0// the pT of the second highest pT photon...
